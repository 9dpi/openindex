# OpenIndex Registry (v1)
> We don’t list projects. We surface systems the world quietly depends on.

**OpenIndex** is a living registry of the open-source infrastructure that forms the backbone of modern society. We focus on systems that are critical, verifiable, and evidence-based.

## 🔒 Source of Truth (v1)
This project is governed by its **[Immutable Architecture (v1)](architecture.md)**.
- **Locked Milestone**: This version represents the solidified PRD and architectural anchor.
- **Mutation Policy**: Append-only via versioning. Changes to core logic require a move to v2.

## 🧠 The "Soft Magic" Philosophy
OpenIndex uses atmospheric intelligence to bridge technical depth and non-technical clarity.

### 🏗️ Our Four Arms of Discovery
1. **Institutional Gold**: Systems used by major global organizations (WHO, Microsoft, etc.).
2. **Silent Infra**: Essential systems with high reliability but low marketing.
3. **Academic-to-Open**: Research-grade innovations transitioning to production.
4. **Community Curators**: Peer-nominated systems verified by our confidence layer.

### ⚡ Evaluation Framework
Every record must answer:
1. *Why does this exist?*
2. *When do people rely on it?*
3. *Without it, what breaks?*
